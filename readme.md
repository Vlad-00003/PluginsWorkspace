### Workspace for creating plugins for rust with oxided, including auto-updater.

Upon compiling project, every reference would be downloaded automatically.

Or you can run **DownloadReferences** (or the **_color** version) to update references.

*I wasn't able to find a way to redirect bat file output to the visual studio output console, so you would only receive message then the process would be over.*

Everything from RustDedicated_Data\Managed would be available, so you can add reference to any file you need in addition to the core reference list.

Requirements:
* _Windows 10 v1803 or higher_
* _Microsoft Visual Studio 2017_
* _.NET Framework 4.6.1_
